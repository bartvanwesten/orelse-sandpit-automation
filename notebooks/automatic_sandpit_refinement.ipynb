    "# Automatic Sandpit Refinement for D-Flow FM\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an automated workflow for refining unstructured grids around sandpit areas in D-Flow FM models. The refinement process uses Casulli refinement to gradually transition from coarse background resolution to fine target resolution.\n",
