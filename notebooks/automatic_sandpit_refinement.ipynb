    "# Automatic Sandpit Refinement for D-Flow FM\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an automated workflow for refining unstructured grids around sandpit areas in D-Flow FM models. The refinement process uses Casulli refinement to gradually transition from coarse background resolution to fine target resolution.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Configuration**: Set file paths and refinement parameters\n",
    "2. **Load Grid and Polygons**: Load the grid and create/load sandpit polygons\n",
    "3. **Plan Refinement**: Analyze grid resolution and generate refinement zones\n",
    "4. **Execute Refinement**: Apply Casulli refinement to the grid\n",
    "5. **Monitor Quality** (Optional): Analyze grid quality metrics\n",
